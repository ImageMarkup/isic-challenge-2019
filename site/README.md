# Background

Skin cancer is the most common cancer globally, with melanoma being the most deadly form. Dermoscopy
is a skin imaging modality that has demonstrated improvement for diagnosis of skin cancer compared
to unaided visual inspection. However, clinicians should receive adequate training for those
improvements to be realized. In order to make expertise more widely available, the International
Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) has developed the ISIC Archive, an international repository of
dermoscopic images, for both the purposes of clinical training, and for supporting technical
research toward automated algorithmic analysis by hosting the ISIC Challenges.

# Task
The goal for ISIC 2019 is classify dermoscopic images among nine different diagnostic categories:
1. Melanoma
2. Melanocytic nevus
3. Basal cell carcinoma
4. Actinic keratosis
5. Benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis)
6. Dermatofibroma
7. Vascular lesion
8. Squamous cell carcinoma
9. None of the others

25,332 images are available for training across 8 different categories. Additionally, the test
dataset (planned release August 2nd) will contain an additional outlier class not represented in
the training data, which developed systems must be able to identify.

Two tasks will be available for participation: 1) classify dermoscopic images without meta-data,
and 2) classify images with additional available meta-data. Task 1's deadline will be August 9th.
Task 2 will be August 16th, after release of test meta-data on August 9th. Participants of Task 2
must submit to Task 1 as well, though participants can submit to Task 1 alone.

In addition to submitting predictions, each competitor is required to submit a link to a manuscript
describing the methods used to generate predictions.
